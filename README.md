This action makes it easy for **GitHub Actions** users to dynamically **start**, **stop**, and manage **EC2 instances** as **self-hosted runners**, ensuring faster, more flexible, and cost-efficient workflows.

### ‚úÖ Features

- Launch an EC2 instance with a GitHub self-hosted runner
- Automatically register and unregister the runner
- Optional configuration for instance type, volume size, and timeout
- Stop and terminate the runner instance after use

### üì§ Outputs

| Name              | Description                             |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `label`           | GitHub runner label (used in `runs-on`) |
| `ec2-instance-id` | Instance ID of the launched EC2 runner  |

### üöÄ Usage

This action can be used in two modes: `start` and `stop`.

#### üü¢ Start Mode

In `start` mode, it launches an EC2 instance, registers it as a GitHub Actions runner, and returns the `label` and `instance ID` as outputs. Use this step at the beginning of your workflow to start an EC2 runner on demand.

```yaml
setup-runner:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  # These outputs (the EC2 instance ID and the GitHub runner label) will be used by other jobs later
  # in the workflow to run steps on the runner and clean up the resources when finished.
  outputs:
    label: ${{ steps.start-runner.outputs.label }}
    ec2-instance-id: ${{ steps.start-runner.outputs.ec2-instance-id }}

  steps:
    # Use 'aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v4' to authenticate with AWS.
    # It securely loads credentials from GitHub Secrets so the workflow can manage EC2 instances.
    - name: AWS credentials
      uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v4
      with:
        aws-region: ${{ secrets.AWS_REGION }}
        aws-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
        aws-secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}

    # Launch a new EC2 instance using the specified AMI. It will install the GitHub Actions runner,
    # register it to your repository and make it available to run jobs dynamically.
    - name: Start Runner
      id: start-runner
      uses: evners/on-demand-ec2-github-runner@v1
      with:
        ec2-ami-id: ${{ secrets.EC2_AMI_ID }}
        github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

You can then use the runner in a following job using the `label` output:

```yaml
your-job:
  needs: setup-runner
  runs-on: ${{ needs.setup-runner.outputs.label }} # Pass the label to use the runner.
  steps:
    - name: Run your job
      run: |
        echo "Running on EC2 self-hosted runner!"
```

#### üî¥ Stop Mode

In `stop` mode, it terminates the EC2 instance and removes the runner from GitHub.

```yaml
stop-runner:
  if: always() # Ensures this job runs even if earlier jobs fail.
  needs: [setup-runner, your-job]
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
    # Use 'aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v4' to authenticate with AWS.
    # It securely loads credentials from GitHub Secrets so the workflow can terminate the EC2 instance.
    - name: AWS credentials
      uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v4
      with:
        aws-region: ${{ secrets.AWS_REGION }}
        aws-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
        aws-secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}

    # Use the 'evners/on-demand-ec2-runner@v1' action in 'stop' mode to terminate the EC2 instance
    # and automatically remove the self-hosted runner from GitHub.
    - name: Stop Runner
      uses: evners/on-demand-ec2-runner@v1
      with:
        mode: 'stop'
        label: ${{needs.setup-runner.outputs.label }}
        github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        ec2-instance-id: ${{ needs.setup-runner.outputs.ec2-instance-id }}
```
